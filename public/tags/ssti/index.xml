      <description>Late is an easy machine that has a unique server-side template injection via the image ocr functionality provided by the site. Once you’re on the box there are two key findings. First is that the user has write permissions to a folder in the root $PATH. The second is that a script runs as root every time someone remotes into the box. The script in question uses several system commands that can be “tricked” into using our own commands by placing them closer to the front of $PATH.</description>
